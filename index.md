In my current position as postdoc at the Seminar for Applied Mathematics at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, I am interested in the approximation of functions by deep neural networks (DNNs) in the context of partial differential equations (PDEs). This includes the approximation of PDE solutions as a function of spatial coordinates, taken from a bounded, Lipschitz, polyhedral domain, as well as uncertainty quantification, where we consider a PDE containing parameters and approximate the parameter-dependent solution and other quantities of interest. As a general theme, we prove for a range of applications that DNNs can perform almost as well as the best currently known (piecewise) polynomial approximation methods.
